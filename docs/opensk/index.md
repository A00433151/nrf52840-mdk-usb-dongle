# OpenSK <br><small>An open-source implementation for security keys written in Rust that supports both FIDO U2F and FIDO2 standards.</small>

## Introduction

[OpenSK](https://github.com/google/OpenSK) released by Google is a fully open-source implementation for security keys written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) that supports both FIDO U2F and FIDO2 standards.

OpenSK is based on the FIDO2 specifications, which combine the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) [Web Authentication (WebAuthn) specification](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/) and FIDO Alliance’s corresponding [Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/download/).

The nRF52840 MDK USB Dongle works well with OpenSK. Taking advantage of the UF2 Bootloader, you can easily program the OpenSK by just copying the `.uf2`-format image to the flash drive.
